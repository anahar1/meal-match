# MealMatch

This application facilitates the collaborative decision-making process between two individuals in selecting a dining venue.

The initial user logs in and inputs their and the other person's preferred cuisine options, along with the desired location. The application presents a list of highly-rated restaurants that align with both cuisine preferences. The user then rates these restaurants and can share the resulting link with the second person, who subsequently rates their own preferred options. The restaurant with the highest overall desirability rating is ultimately chosen as the preferred dining destination.
